## Introduction

- Want to summarize a continuous random variable.

- Natural summaries are given by the mean $\mu$ and the standard deviation $\sigma$

- They look like summaries for a discrete random variable, but sums are replaced by integrals.

## The Mean

- The mean $\mu$, or expected value of $X$, is given by
\begin{equation}
\mu = E(X) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x f(x) dx.
\end{equation}

- Interpretation: If one observes a large number of values of $X$, then $\mu$ is approximately equal to the sample mean $\bar X$  of these random values of $X$.

## The Standard Deviation

- To define the spread of the values of $X$, one computes the average squared deviation about the mean, the variance, 
\begin{equation}
 \sigma^2 = Var(X) = E(X - \mu)^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty (x - \mu)^2 f(x) dx.
\end{equation}

- The standard deviation of $X$, $\sigma$, is defined to be the square root of the variance.

## Example

- Return to the bus waiting time problem.  

- Using the definition of $f$, one gets that the mean is equal to 
 $$
 \mu = \int_0^{10} x \left(\frac{3x^2}{1000}\right) dx.
 $$

- Performing the integration, one gets
$$
 \mu = \int_0^{10} x \left(\frac{3x^2}{1000}\right) dx = \frac{3 x^4}{4000} \Big|^{10}_0 = \frac{3 (10)^4}{1000} = 7.5.
$$

- On, the average, one expects the longest wait in a week to be 7.5 minutes.

## Computing the standard deviation

- The computation of the variance is a bit more tedious.  
  $$
 \sigma^2 = \int_0^{10} (x -\mu)^2  \left(\frac{3x^2}{1000}\right) dx = 3.75.
 $$

- The standard deviation of $X$ is  $\sigma = \sqrt{3.75} = 1.94$.

## A Percentile

- A useful summary of a continuous random variable 

- The 70th percentile is the value of $X$, call it $x$, such that 70\% of the probability is to the left.  

```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200, fig.cap = "Illustration of the 70th percentile."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/continuous12.png")
```

## Finding a Percentile

- The 70th percentile, call it $x_{70}$, satisfies the equation
$$
P(X \le x_{70}) = 0.70.
$$



 - Since the left hand side of the equation is the cdf $F$, the equation is written as
 
 $$
 F(x_{70}) = 0.70,
 $$
 - that is,
 
 $$
 \frac{x_{70}^3}{1000} = 0.70.
 $$
 
## Finding a Percentile
 
 - To find the 70th percentile, solve 
 $$
 \frac{x_{70}^3}{1000} = 0.70.
 $$
 for $x_{70}$
 
 - After some algebra, we get
 $$
 x_{70} = \sqrt[3]{700} = 8.88.
 $$

- This means that if one waits many weeks for this bus, approximately 70% of the longest waiting times will be shorter than 8.88 minutes.
