## Definition

- There is a basic function that can be computed that will simplify these probability computations for a continuous random variable.

- Choose an arbitrary point $x$ -- the cumulative distribution function at $x$, or cdf for short, is the probability that $W$ is less than or equal to $x$:
\begin{equation}
F(x) = P(W \le x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f(w) dw.
\end{equation}

## Our Example

- Here is the density function for our longest waiting time.


```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200, fig.cap = "Density curve for the longest waiting time $W$."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/continuous5.png")
```

## Defining the cdf $F(x)$

 - Suppose one chooses a value of $x$ in the interval (0, 10).  Then $F(x)$ would be the area under the density curve between 0 and $x$ shown below.

```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200, fig.cap = "Illustration of the cumulative density function."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/continuous9.png")
```

## Some Calculus

Writing this area as an integral, one computes $F(x)$ as
 $$
F(x) = P(W \le x) = \int_0^x \frac{3w^2}{1000} dw = \frac{w^3}{1000}\Big|^{x}_0 = \frac{x^3}{1000}.
$$
This formula is valid for any value of  x in the interval (0, 10).

## Define $F(x)$ for all values of $x$

-	If $x$ is a value smaller or equal to 0, the probability that $W$ is smaller than $x$ is equal to 0.  

-	If $x$ is greater or equal to 10,  the probability that $W$ is smaller than $x$ is 1.  

Putting all together, one sees that the cdf $F$ is given by
$$
F(x) = 
 \begin{cases}
                                   0, & x \le 0  \\
                                   x^3 / 1000, & 0 < x < 10 \\
  1, & x \ge 10,
  \end{cases}
$$

## Here is the graph
 
```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200, fig.cap = "The cumulative density function, $F(x)$, of the bus waiting example."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/continuous10.png")
```

## Computing Probabilities Using the CDF

- Once the cdf function $F$ is given, probabilities are found  by evaluating $F$ at different points.  

- No additional integration is needed.

## Waiting Time Example

- Recall that we found cdf to be equal to:

$$
F(x) = 
 \begin{cases}
                                   0, & x \le 0  \\
                                   x^3 / 1000, & 0 < x < 10 \\
  1, & x \ge 10,
  \end{cases}
$$

## Computing a Probability

- To find the probability that the maximum waiting time $W$ is less than equal to 6 minutes, one just computes $F(6) = P(W \le 6) = 6^3 / 1000 = 0.216$ which is shown in Figure 5.15.


```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200, fig.cap = "The cumulative density function $F(x)$ and evaluation of $F(6) = P(W <= 6)$."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/continuous11.png")
```

 
## Computing a Greater-Than Probability

To compute the probability that the maximum waiting time exceeds 8 minutes, first note that "exceeding 8 minutes" is the complement event to "less than or equal to 8 minutes", and so
$$
P(W > 8) = 1 - P(W \le 8)  
$$
$$
= 1 - F(8) 
$$
$$
= 1 - \frac{8^3}{1000} = 0.488.
$$

## Computing a Between Probability

 Likewise, if one is interested in the chance that the waiting time $W$ falls between 2 and 4,  represent the probability as the difference of two "less-than" probabilities, and then subtract the two values of F.
 
 $$
P(2 < W < 4) = P(W \le 4) - P(W \le 2)  
$$
$$
= F(4) - F(2) 
$$
$$
= \frac{4^3}{1000} - \frac{2^3}{1000} = 0.056.
$$
