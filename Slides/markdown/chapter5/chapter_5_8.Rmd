## A Binomial Story

- Suppose that half of one's student body is female and one takes a sample survey of $n$ students to learn if they are interested in using a new proposed recreational sports complex.  

- Let $X$ denote the number of females in the sample. 

- We know that $X$ will be distributed Binomial with parameters $n$ and $p=1/2$.

- Let's explore the shape of these binomial distributions for different sample sizes.

## Binomial Shapes with $p = 0.5$

- Here are Binomial probabilities for probability of success $p = 0.1$ and sample sizes $n$ = 10, 20, 50, and 100.

```{r,  echo = FALSE, , out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/fourplots.png")
```

## Comments

- Note that each distribution is symmetric about the mean  $\mu = n p$.  

- Also the shape of the distribution seems to resemble a Normal curve as the number of trials $n$ increases.

## Binomial Shapes with $p = 0.1$

- Same binomial story but suppose the probability of success is $p = 0.1$ instead of $p = 0.5$.

- Below figure shows the probability distributions again for the sample sizes $n$ = 10, 20, 50, and 100.  

```{r,  echo = FALSE, , out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/fourplots2.png")
```

## Comments

- Again note that as $n$ increases, the probabilities become more Normal-shaped and the Normal curve seems to be a good match for $n=100$.


 
## Normal approximation to binomial

- Have a Binomial random variable $X$ with $n$ trials and probability of success $p$

- As the number of trials $n$ approaches infinity, the distribution of the standardized score
\begin{equation}
Z = \frac{X - n p}{\sqrt{n p (1 - p)}}
\end{equation}

approaches a Normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.  

- It means, that for a large number of trials, one can approximate a Binomial random variable $X$ by a Normal random variable with 
\begin{equation}
 \mu = n p, \, \, \, \sigma = \sqrt{n p (1 - p)}.
\end{equation}

## Example

- Suppose that 10\% of the student body would use the new recreational sports complex.  

- One takes a random sample of 100 students --- what's the probability that 5 or fewer students in the sample would use the new facility?

- The random variable $X$ in this problem is the number 
of students in the sample that would use the facility.  
- $X$ has a Binomial distribution with 
$n = 100$ and $p = 0.1$.

## Approximation

- The exact binomial distribution is shown below.

- We can approximate by a Normal curve with $\mu = 100 (0.1) = 10$ and $\sigma = \sqrt{100 (0.1) (0.9)} = 3$
 
 - Note that it is a pretty good fit to the histogram.
 

```{r,  echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Histogram of Binomial probabilities, with the approximated Normal curve on top.", out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/binormal.png")
```
 
## Binomial Computations Using a Normal Curve

- One is interested in the probability that at most 5 students use the facility -- $P(X \le  5)$.  

- This probability is approximated by the area under a Normal(10, 3) curve between $X=0$ and $X=5$. 

- Using the R ```pnorm()```\index{pnorm()} function, we compute this Normal curve area to be

```{r}
pnorm(5, 10, 3) - pnorm(0, 10, 3)
```

## How accurate is this normal approximation?

- Compare with an exact binomial calculation. Using the ```pbinom()```, we find the probability that $X$ is at most 5 is

```{r}
pbinom(5, size = 100, prob = 0.10)
```

- Here one sees that the Normal approximation gives a similar answer to the exact Binomial computation.
