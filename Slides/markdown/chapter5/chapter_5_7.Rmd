## Some Marathon Data

- Let's look at some data from a marathon race.

- 2515 women completed Grandma's Marathon. Here is a histogram of these times, measured in minutes.

```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/grandma1.png")
```

## Normal Curve

- These measured times have a bell shape.  

- Overlay a Normal curve on top of this histogram.  

- Measurement data like this marathon time data are often well approximated by a Normal curve.

 ```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/grandma2.png")
```

## Formula

- A Normal density curve has the general form
$$
 f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma} \exp\left\{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}\right\}, -\infty < x < \infty.
$$

- Described by two parameters -- the mean $\mu$ and the standard deviation $\sigma$.  

- The mean $\mu$ is the center of the curve.  Looking at the Normal curve above, one sees that the curve is centered about 270 minutes.

- The number $\sigma$, the standard deviation, describes the spread of the curve.  

## Early use of the Normal curve
 
- By the 19th century, it was believed by some scientists such as Adolphe Quetelet that the Normal curve would represent the distribution of any group of homogeneous measurements.  

- Quetelet considered the frequency measurements for the chest circumference measurements (in inches) for 5738 Scottish soldiers taken from the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal (1817).  


 ```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 100}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/chestmeasurements.png")
```

## Computing Normal probabilities

- Suppose that the Normal density with $\mu$ = 274 minutes and $\sigma$= 43 minutes represents the distribution of women racing times.  

- Say one is interested in the probability that a runner completes the race less than 4 hours or 240 minutes.  

- One computes this probability by finding an area under the Normal curve.  
 
 
 ```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 150, fig.cap = "Normal density with mean 274 and standard deviation 43, with illustration of the area under the curve less than 240 (minutes)."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/newnormal1.png")
```
 
 
## Normal Probability Calculations

- One expresses this area as the integral

  $$
P(X \le 240) = \int_{-\infty}^{240} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma} \exp\left\{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}\right\} dx
 $$

- Cannot integrate this function analytically.

- Instead one finds this area by use of the R  ```pnorm()```\index{pnorm()} function in R. This function is used for three examples, illustrating the computation of three types of areas.

- Work with marathon times that are approximately Normally distributed with mean $\mu$ = 274 and standard deviation $\sigma$ = 43.  


## Finding a "less than" area

- One is interested in the probability that a  marathon runner completes the race in under 240 minutes.  

- One wishes to find $P(X < 240)$ which is the area under the Normal curve to the left of 240.  

- The function value \texttt{pnorm(x, m, s)} gives the value of the cdf of a Normal random variable with mean $\mu = a$ and $\sigma = s$ evaluated at the value $x$.

- For our example, the desired probability is given by

```{r}
pnorm(240, 274, 43)
```

## Finding a "between two values" area  
  
- Suppose one wishes to compute the probability that a marathon runner completes a race between two values, such as $P(230 < X < 280)$.

```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/newnormal2.png")
```

## Finding a "between two values" area

- One  writes this probability as the difference of two "less than" probabilities:

$$
P(230 < X < 280)  = P(X < 280) - P(X < 230) \\
  = F(280) - F(230), 
$$

where $F(x)$ is the cdf of a Normal(274, 43) random variable evaluated at $x$. 

- By use of the \texttt{pnorm()} function, this probability is equal to

```{r}
pnorm(280, 274, 43) - pnorm(230, 274, 43)
```

## Finding a "greater than" area

- One might be interested in the probability that $X$ is greater than some value, such as $P(X > 300)$, the probability a  runner takes more than 300 minutes to complete the race.


```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/newnormal3.png")
```

## Finding a "greater than" area

- This probability is found by the complement property of probability, that 
$$
P(X > 300)  = 1 - P(X \le 300) \\
  = 1 - F(300).
$$

-  Therefore, one uses the \texttt{pnorm()} function to compute the probability that $X$ is smaller than 300, and then subtract the answer from 1.

```{r}
1 - pnorm(300, 274, 43) 
```

## Computing Normal Percentiles


- Suppose that t-shirts will be given away to the runners who get the 25\% fastest times.  How fast does a runner need to run the race to get a t-shirt?

- The 25th percentile of the distribution is a time, call it $x_{25}$, such that 25 percent of all times are smaller than $x_{25}$.  

 ```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200, fig.cap = "Normal density with mean 274 and standard deviation 43, with illustration of the 25th percentile."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/newnormal4.png")
```

## Calculating Normal Percentiles

 - Percentiles of a Normal curve are  computed in R by use of the ```qnorm()``` function.  
 
 - ```qnorm(p, m, s)``` gives the percentile of a Normal($m, s$) curve corresponding to a "left area" of ```p```.  
 
 - Here the value of ```p``` is 0.25, and so the 25th percentile of the running times (with mean 274 minutes and standard deviation 43 minutes) is computed to be

```{r}
qnorm(0.25, 274, 43)
```
 
- This means one needs to run faster (lower) than 245.0 minutes to get a t-shirt in this competition.

## Another Percentile

- Suppose one needs to complete the race faster than 10% of the runners - how fast does one need to run?
One wishes to find the 90th percentile, $x_{90}$ of the Normal distribution.
 
```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 500}
normal_quantile(0.9, c(274, 43))
```

- 90 percent of the runners run faster than 329 minutes.
