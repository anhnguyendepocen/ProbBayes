## Spinner experiment

- Consider a spinner experiment described in Section 5.1 where the location of the spinner $X$ can be any number between 0 and 100.  

- Here are some spins.

|      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 95.0 | 23.1 | 60.7 | 48.6 | 89.1 | 76.2 | 45.6 | 1.9  | 93.5 | 91.7 |
| 82.1 | 44.5 | 61.5 | 79.2 | 92.2 | 73.8 | 17.6 | 40.6 | 41.0 | 89.4 |

## Graph of spins

- A histogram\index{histogram} of these values of $X$ is shown below.     
 

```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/continuous1.png")
```

## Many spins

- Let's try spinning 1000 times-- a histogram of the spins is shown below.
 
 ```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/continuous2.png")
```


## General shape

- The general shape of the histogram seems to be pretty flat or Uniform over the entire interval of possible values of $X$ between 0 and 100.

- If we spun the spinner a zillion times then the shape of the histogram looks close to the Uniform density.
 
 ```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/continuous0.png")
```

## Density curve

- For a continuous random variable $X$, such as the case of the spinner result here,  one represents probabilities by means of a smooth curve that is called a density curve

- When $X$ is continuous, then probabilities are represented by areas under the density curve.

## Simple example of finding an area

- What is the chance that the spinner result falls between 0 and 100?  

- This probability is represented by the total area under the flat line between 0 and 100.  

- Since the area of this rectangle is given by height times base, and the base is equal to 100, the height of this density curve must be 1/100 = 0.01. 

## Computing probabilities 

- What is the probability the spin falls between 20 and 60?  

- This is equal to the shaded area under the Uniform density between 20 and 60.  The base is $60 - 20 = 40$ and the height is 0.01,  so 
$$
 P(20 < X < 60) = 40 (0.01) = 0.4.
 $$

## Here's the picture

```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200, fig.cap = "Illustration of finding the probability of $P(20 < X < 60)$."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/continuous3.png")
```

## What is the probability the spin is greater than 80?  

By finding the area of the shaded rectangle, we see that $P(X > 80)$ = 20 (0.01) = 0.2.


```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200, fig.cap = "Illustration of finding the probability of $P(X > 80)$."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/continuous4.png")
```

## Summary

- A continuous random variable can take an infinite number of values.

- We represent probabilities by use of a density curve.

- Compute probabilities by finding areas under a density curve.
