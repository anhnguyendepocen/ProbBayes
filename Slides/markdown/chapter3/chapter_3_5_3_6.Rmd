## Introduction

-- There is a formal definition of conditional probability .

- Suppose one has two events $A$ and $B$ where the probability of event $B$ is positive, that is $P(B) > 0.$  

- Then the probability of $A$ given $B$ is defined as the quotient
$$
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}.
$$
 
## How many boys?

- Suppose a couple has four children.  One is told that this couple has at least one boy.   What is the chance that they have exactly two boys?

- If one lets $L$ be the event "at least one boy" and $B$ be the event "have two boys", one wishes to find $P(B \mid L).$

## The sample space

- Represent the genders of the four children (from youngest to oldest) as a sequence of four letters.

- There are 16 possible outcomes of four births

|          |          |          |          |
| :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
| \(BBBB\) | \(BGBB\) | \(GBBB\) | \(GGBB\) |
| \(BBBG\) | \(BGBG\) | \(GBBG\) | \(GGBG\) |
| \(BBGB\) | \(BGGB\) | \(GBGB\) | \(GGGB\) |
| \(BBGG\) | \(BGGG\) | \(GBGG\) | \(GGGG\) |

- If one assumes that boys and girls are equally likely, each outcome is assigned a probability of 1/16.  

## Computation

- Applying the definition of conditional probability, one has
 $$
P(B \mid L) = \frac{P(B \cap L)}{P(L)}.
$$

- There are 15 outcomes in the set $L$, and 6 outcomes where both events $B$ and $L$ occur.  

- So using the definition

$$
P(B \mid L) = \frac{6/16}{15/16} = \frac{6}{15}.
$$


## The multiplication rule


- If one takes the conditional probability definition and multiplies both sides of the equation by $P(B)$, one obtains the multiplication rule

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(B) P(A \mid B).
$$
 
## Choosing balls from a random bowl

- Suppose one has two bowls -- Bowl 1 is filled with one white and 5 black balls, and Bowl 2 has 4 white and 2 black balls.  

- One first spins the spinner below that determines which bowl to select, and then selects one ball from the bowl. 

- What the chance that the ball one selects is white?
 
## The experiment

 ```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 300}
knitr::include_graphics("chapter3/bowlspinner.png")
```

## A tree diagram

 
 ```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 180}
knitr::include_graphics("chapter3/tree5.png")
```

## Add probabilities to diagram

- Since one quarter of the spinner region is "Bowl 1", the chance of choosing Bowl 1 is 1/4 and so the chance of choosing Bowl 2 is 3/4

- Also one knows that if  Bowl 1 is selected, the chances of choosing a white ball and a black ball are respectively 1/6 and 5/6  

- Also, if one selects Bowl 2, the conditional probabilities of selecting a white ball and a black ball are given by $P$(white $\mid$ Bowl 2) = 4/6 and $P$(black $\mid$ Bowl 2) = 2/6

## Labeled tree diagram

```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 180}
knitr::include_graphics("chapter3/tree6.png")
```

## Computing probabilities
 
-  What is the probability of selecting Bowl 1 and selecting a white ball?  

- By the multiplication rule

\begin{align*} 
P({\rm Bowl \, 1} \cap {\rm white \, ball}) &=  P({\rm Bowl \, 1}) P({\rm white \, ball} \mid {\rm Bowl \, 1})
 \\ 
 &=  \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{24}.
\end{align*}
 
- One is just multiplying probabilities along the top branch of the tree.

## Computing probabilities

- What is the probability of selecting a white ball?  

- There are two ways of selecting a white depending on which bowl is selected.  One can either (1) select Bowl 1 and choose a white ball or (2) select Bowl 2 and choose a white ball.   

- One finds the probability of each of the two outcomes and add the probabilities

\begin{align*}
P({\rm white \, ball}) & =  P({\rm Bowl \, 1} \cap {\rm white \, ball}) + P({\rm Bowl \, 2} \cap {\rm white \, ball}) \\ 
& =  \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{6} + \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{6} = \frac{13}{24}.
\end{align*}
