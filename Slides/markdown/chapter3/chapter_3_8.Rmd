## Introduction

- Probabilities are conditional in that one's opinion about an event is dependent on our current state of knowledge.  

- As we gain new information, our probabilities can change.  

- Bayes' rule provides a mechanism for changing our probabilities when we obtain new data.

## Blood test example


- You are given a blood test for a rare disease.  The proportion of people who currently have this disease is 0.1.  

- The blood test comes back with two results: positive, which is some indication that you may have the disease, or negative.  

- It is possible that the test will give the wrong result.  If you have the disease, it will give a negative reading with probability 0.2.  Likewise, it will give a false positive\index{false positive} result with probability 0.2.  

- Suppose that you have a blood test and the result is positive.  Should you be concerned that you have the disease?

## Two alternatives

- There are two possible alternatives:  you have the disease, or you don't have the disease.  

- Before you have a blood test, you assign probabilities to "have disease" and "don't have disease" that reflect the plausibility of these two models.  

- You assign the event "have disease" a probability of 0.1  By the complement property\index{complement!property}, this implies that the event "don't have disease" has  a probability of 1- 0.1 = 0.9. 

## Data

- The new information that one obtains to learn about the different models is called data.  

- Here the data is the result of the blood test.  Here the two possible data results are a positive result ($+$) or a negative result ($-$).  

- If one "has the disease," the probability of a $+$ observation is 0.8 and the probability of a $-$ observation is 0.2.  One writes
 $$
 P(+ \mid {\rm disease}) = 0.8, \, \, P(- \mid {\rm disease}) = 0.2.
 $$
Likewise, if you don't have the disease
 $$
 P(+ \mid {\rm no \, disease}) = 0.2, \, \, P(- \mid {\rm no \, disease}) = 0.8.
 $$
 
## Probability of interest

- Suppose you take the blood test and the result is positive ($+$) -- what is the chance you really have the disease?  
 $$
 P({\rm disease} \mid +).
 $$

- Here the focus is on the so-called inverse probability\index{inverse probability}   -- the probability of having the disease given a positive blood test result.

- We describe the computation of this inverse probability using two methods.  

## Method 1:  Using a tree diagram

- A person either has or does not have the disease, and given the person's disease state, he or she either gets a positive or negative test result.  

- One represents the outcomes by a tree diagram where the first set of branches corresponds to the disease states and the second set of branches corresponds to the blood test results.  

## The tree diagram

```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width  = 200}

```

## Computation

- By the definition of conditional probability,
 $$
 P({\rm disease} \mid +) = \frac{P({\rm disease} \cap +)}{P(+)}.
 $$

- One finds the numerator $P({\rm disease} \cap +)$ by use of the multiplication rule\index{multiplication rule!probability}:
  \begin{align*}
P({\rm disease} \cap +) &= P({\rm disease}) P(+ \mid {\rm disease})  \\
& = 0.1 \times 0.8 = 0.08.
 \end{align*}

- In the tree diagram, one is multiplying probabilities along the disease/$+$ branch to find this probability.

## Computation
 
- To find the denominator $P(+)$, note that there are two ways of getting a positive blood test result.   

- These two outcomes are the disease/$+$ and no disease/$+$ branches of the tree.  One finds the probability of each outcome, and then sum the outcome probabilities:
 \begin{align*}
P(+) &= P({\rm disease} \cap +) + P({\rm no} \, {\rm disease} \cap +)  \\
& = P({\rm disease}) P(+ \mid {\rm disease}) + P({\rm no \, disease})P(+ \mid {\rm no \, disease}) \\
& = 0.1 \times 0.8 + 0.9 \times 0.2 \\
& = 0.26.
 \end{align*}
 
- So the probability of having the disease, given a positive blood test result is
$$
P({\rm disease} \mid +) = \frac{P({\rm disease} \cap +)}{P(+)} = \frac{0.08}{0.26} = 0.31.
$$

## Method 2:  Using a Bayes' box

- Suppose there are 1000 people in the community -- one places "1000' in the lower right corner of the table.

|         |                    |   |       |       |
| :-----: | :----------------: | :-: | :---: | :---: |
|         |                    | + | \(-\) | TOTAL |
| Disease |    Have disease    |   |       |       |
| status  | Don’t have disease |   |       |       |
|  TOTAL  |                    |   |       | 1000  |

## Method 2:  Using a Bayes' box

- One knows that the chance of getting the disease is 10\% -- so one expects 10\% of the 1000 = 100 people to have the disease and the remaining 900 people to be disease-free.  

|         |                    |   |       |       |
| :-----: | :----------------: | :-: | :---: | :---: |
|         |                    | + | \(-\) | TOTAL |
| Disease |    Have disease    |   |       |  100  |
| status  | Don’t have disease |   |       |  900  |
|  TOTAL  |                    |   |       | 1000  |

## Method 2:  Using a Bayes' box

- One knows the test will err with probability 0.2.  So if 100 people have the disease, one expects 20\% of 100 = 20 to have a negative test result and 80 will have a positive result

- Likewise, if 900 people are disease-free, then 20\% of 900 = 180 will have an incorrect positive result and the remaining 720 will have a negative result

|         |                    |     |       |       |
| :-----: | :----------------: | :-: | :---: | :---: |
|         |                    |  +  | \(-\) | TOTAL |
| Disease |    Have disease    | 80  |  20   |  100  |
| status  | Don’t have disease | 180 |  720  |  900  |
|  TOTAL  |                    |     |       | 1000  |

## Method 2:  Using a Bayes' box

- Now one is ready to compute the probability of interest  $P({\rm disease} \mid +)$  from the table of counts.  

- Restrict attention to the $+$ column of the table -- there are 260 people had a positive test result.  Of these 260, 80 actually had the disease, so
$$
P({\rm disease} \mid +) = \frac{80}{260} = 0.31.
$$
 

## Comments

-  Initially you had a small probability of 0.10 of having the disease

- The new probability of having the disease (0.31) is larger than the initial probability since a positive blood test was observed

- Note that since the new probability is under 0.5, it is still unlikely you have the disease
