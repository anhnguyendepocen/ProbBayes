## A Probability Distribution

- Suppose $X$ is a discrete random variable that only assigns probability to a discrete set of values.  

- The function $f(x)$ is a probability mass function (pmf) for $X$ if the function satisfies two properties.

1. $f(x) \ge 0$ for each possible value $x$ of $X$
2. $\sum_x f(x) = 1$

- You can check that the function $f()$ in our coin-tossing example satisfies the two properties.

## Graphing a Probability Distribution.

- One graphically displays a probability distribution with a bar graph\index{bar graph}.  

```{r, echo = FALSE , out.width = 200, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Probability distribution of the net gains for Peter in the Peter-Paul game."}
library(ProbBayes)
df <- data.frame(Gain = c(-10, -6, -2, 2, 6, 10),
                 Probability = c(1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1) / 32)
prob_plot(df)
```

## Comments

- This figure shows that it is most likely for Peter to finish with a net gain of $+2$ or $-2$ dollars.  

- Also note the symmetry of the graph -- the symmetry about the value 0 indicates that this game is fair.   


## Simulating the Peter-Paul Gam

- One can simulate this game in R.  A function ```one_play()```\index{one\_play()} is written which will play the game one time, returning the net gain for Paul.

```{r}
one_play <- function(){
  flips <- sample(c("H", "T"), 
                  size = 5,
                  replace = TRUE)
  2 * sum(flips == "H") -
       2 * sum(flips == "T")
}
```

## Playing the Game Many Times

- The ```replicate()```\index{replicate()} function is used to simulate 1000 plays of the game and the net gains are stored in the vector ```G```.  

- The figure on the next slide constructs a bar graph of the net gains, -- it resembles the graph of the probability distribution of $G$.

```
G <- replicate(1000, one_play())
bar_plot(G)
```
