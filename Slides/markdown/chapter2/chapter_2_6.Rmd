## Creating silly words

- Suppose one is making up silly words from the letters "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", like

bacedf, decabf, eabcfd

- How many silly words can one make up?  

- Using the permutation rule\index{permutations!rule}, the number of possible permutations\index{permutations} is 
$$
6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times ...\times 1.
$$

## Second counting rule

- Suppose one has six letters "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", and one is going to choose three of the letters to construct a three-letter word.  

- One cannot choose the same letter twice and the order in which one chooses the letters is not important.  

- Here one is interested in the number of combinations\index{combinations} -- the number of ways of choosing three letters from six is equal to
$$
{6 \choose 3} = \frac{6!}{3! \, 3!}.
$$
 
## Different arrangement problem

- One randomly arranges the four triangles and five squares as shown below.  

```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width  = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("chapter2/objects.png")
```
 
- What is the chance that the first and last locations are occupied by triangles?  

## What is the difference?

- This is an arrangement problem with one difference -- the objects are not all distinct

- So one cannot use the earlier permutations rule that assumes the objects are distinguishable.

- How can one count the number of possible arrangements?  

## Possible arrangements

- Suppose one writes down a list of nine slots and an arrangement is constructed by placing the triangles and the squares in the nine slots.  
 

```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width  = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("chapter2/objects2.png")
```

## Constructing an arrangement


- First, place the four triangles in four slots, and then place the squares in the remaining slots.

- How many ways can one put the triangles in the slots?  For example, one could place the triangles in slots 1, 3, 4, and 8.
 
 ```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("chapter2/objects3.png")
```

- Or one could place the four triangles in slots 2, 5, 7, and 8.
 
 ```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("chapter2/objects4.png")
```

## Constructing an arrangement

- One specifies an arrangement by choosing four locations from the slot locations \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}.  

- One knows that the number of ways of selecting four objects from a group of nine objects is
$$
{9 \choose 4} = \frac{9!}{4! (9 - 4)!} = 126.
$$
 
- One finishes the arrangement by putting in the squares.  But there is only one way of doing this. 

- So applying the multiplication rule, the number of ways of arranging four triangles and five squares is $126 \times 1 = 126$.

## Permutations Rule for Non-Distinct Objects

- The number of permutations of $n$ non-distinct objects where $r$ are of one type and $n - r$ are of a second type is
$$
{n \choose r} = \frac{n!}{r! (n - r)!}.
$$
 
## Back to example

- Suppose four triangles and five squares are randomly arranged.  What is the chance that the first and last locations are occupied by triangles?

- We know there are 126 ways of mixing up four triangles and five squares.  

- Each possible arrangement is equally likely\index{equally likely} and has a chance of 1/126 of occurring.

## Finding the probability

- One needs to count the number of ways of arranging the triangles and squares so that the first and last positions are filled with triangles.
 
 ```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("chapter2/objects5.png")
```

- If one places triangles in slots 1 and 9, then one is free to arrange the remaining two triangles and five squares in the remaining 7 slots.  By use of the new arrangements formula, the number of ways is
$$
{7 \choose 2} = \frac{7!}{2! (7 - 2)!} = 21
$$
and so the probability the first and last slots are filled with triangles is equal to 21/126.
