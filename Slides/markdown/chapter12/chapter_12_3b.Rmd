## Priors

- When little prior information is available, can construct a weakly informative prior for the regression coefficients as was done in Chapter 11.

- But when prior information is available, a conditional means prior can be constructed for logistic regression with a single predictor.   

- This type of  prior was previously constructed in Chapter 11 for a Normal regression problem in the gas bill example.  

## Conditional means prior

- It is generally difficult to think directly about plausible values of the intercept $\beta_0$ and slope $\beta_1$ since they are not linearly related to the probabilities.

- A conditional means prior indirectly specifies a prior by constructing priors on the probability values $p_1$ and $p_2$ corresponding to two predictor values $x_1^*$ and $x_2^*$.

- By assuming independence, this implies a prior on the probability vector $(p_1^*, p_2^*)$.  

- Since the regression coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are functions of the probability values, this process specifies a prior on the vector $\beta$.

## Conditional means prior

- Consider two values of the predictor $x_1^*$ and $x_2^*$.

- For the first predictor value $x_1^*$, construct a Beta prior for the probability $p^*_1$ with shape parameters $a_1$ and $b_1$.  

- Similarly, for the second predictor value $x_2^*$,  construct a Beta prior for the probability  $p^*_2$ with shape parameters $a_2$ and $b_2$.


- The joint prior\index{joint!prior} for the vector $(p^*_1, p^*_2)$ has the form
$$
\pi(p^*_1, p^*_2) = \pi(p^*_1) \pi(p^*_2).
$$

## Relationship of $p_1$ and $p_2$ with $\beta$

- Prior on $(p^*_1, p^*_2)$ implies a prior on the regression coefficient vector ($\beta_0, \beta_1)$.

- Write the two conditional probabilities $p^*_1$ and $p^*_2$ as  function of the regression coefficient parameters $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ and solve these equations for the $\beta$'s.

$$
\beta_1 
= \frac{\textrm{logit}(p_1^*) - \textrm{logit}(p_2^*)}{x_1^* - x_2^*},  \\
\beta_0 = \textrm{log}\left(\frac{p^*_1}{1-p^*_1}\right) - \beta_1 x_1^*. 
$$

## Example

- Consider two different family incomes (exclusive of the wife's income), say $20,000 and $80,000 (predictor is in $1000 units).  


- Consider the labor participation probability $p_1^*$ for the value $x = 20$, corresponding to  a $20,000 family income.  Suppose one believes  the median of this probability is 0.10 and the 90th percentile\index{percentile} is equal to 0.2.  This belief is matched to a Beta prior with shape parameters 2.52 and 20.08.

- Next the participation probability  $p_2^*$ for the value $x = 80$, corresponding to  a $80,000 family income. The median and 90th percentile of this probability are thought to be 0.7 and 0.8, respectively, and this information is matched to a Beta prior with shape parameters 20.59 and 9.01.

## Graph of Conditional Means Prior

- Each bar displays the 90% interval estimate for the participation probability for a particular value of the family income.

## Conditional Means Prior

Assuming independence of the prior beliefs about the two probabilities, one  represents the joint prior density function for ($p_1^*, p_2^*$) as the product of densities
$$
\pi(p_1^*, p_2^*) = \pi_B(p_1^*, 2.52, 20.08)\pi_B(p_2^*, 20.59, 9.01),
$$
where $\pi_B(y, a, b)$ denotes the Beta density with shape parameters $a$ and $b$.

## Corresponding Prior for $\beta$

- To simulate pairs $(\beta_0, \beta_1)$ from the prior distribution, one  simulates values of the means $p_1^*$ and $p_2^*$ from independent Beta distributions and apply the expressions in the previous slide. 

- Figure displays a scatterplot of the simulated pairs $(\beta_0, \beta_1)$ from the prior.
