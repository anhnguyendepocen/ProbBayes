## A Multiple Regression Model

- Similar to a simple linear regression model, a multiple linear regression model assumes a observation specific mean $\mu_i$ for the $i$-th response variable $Y_i$.
$$
Y_i \mid \mu_i, \sigma \overset{ind}{\sim} \textrm{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma), \, \, i = 1, \cdots, n.
$$

- Assume that the mean of $Y_i$,  $\mu_i$, is a linear function of all predictors. One writes
$$
\mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i,1} + \beta_2 x_{i,2} + \cdots + \beta_r x_{i,r},
$$
where $\mathbf{x}_i = (x_{i,1}, x_{i,2}, \cdots, x_{i,r})$ is a vector of $r$ known predictors for observation $i$, and $\mathbf{\beta} = (\beta_0, \beta_1, \cdots, \beta_r)$ is a vector of unknown regression coefficients shared among all observations. 

## Interpretation for continuous predictors

- For studies where all $r$ predictors are continuous, one interprets the intercept parameter $\beta_0$ as the expected response $\mu_i$ for observation $i$, where all of its predictors take values of 0 

- One can also interpret the slope parameter $\beta_i$  as the change in the expected response $\mu_i$, when the $j$-th predictor, $x_{i,j}$, of observation $i$ increases by a single unit while all remaining $(r-1)$ predictors are constant.

## Categorical Predictors

- In the household expenditures example from the CE data sample, the urban/rural status variable is a binary categorical variable coded as 1 (urban) or 2 (rural).

- It is much more common to consider this variable as a binary (0 or 1) categorical variable that classifies the observations into  two distinct groups: the urban group and the rural group.  

- Define a new indicator variable that takes a value of 0 if the CU is in an urban area, and  a value of 1 if the CU is in a rural area. 

## Regression with an indicator variable

- Consider a simplified regression model with a single predictor, the binary indicator for rural area $x_i$. 

- This simple linear regression model is given by
$$
\mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i  = 
 \begin{cases}
  \beta_0, & \text{ the urban group}; \\
  \beta_0 + \beta_1, & \text{ the rural group}.  \\
  \end{cases}
$$

- Here $\beta_1$ represents the change in the expected response $\mu_i$ from the urban group to the rural group. That is, $\beta_1$ represents the effect of being a member of the rural group.

## Some Data Transformation

- Both the expenditure and income variables are highly skewed.

- Both variables have more even distributions if we apply logarithm transformations.

- So the response variable will be the logarithm of the CU's total expenditure and the continuous predictor will be the logarithm of the CU 12-month income.

## Graph

- Figure  displays  scatterplots of log income and log expenditure where the two panels correspond to urban and rural residents.   

- In each panel there appears to be a positive association\index{association} between log income and log expenditure.

## Multiple Regression Model

- Set up a multiple linear regression model for the log expenditure response including one continuous predictor and one binary categorical predictor. 

- Assume response $$Y_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma)$$

- Expected response $\mu_i$ is expressed as a linear combination of the log income variable and the rural indicator variable.
$$
\mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i, income} + \beta_2 x_{i, rural}.
$$

## Interpret regression coefficients


- Intercept parameter $\beta_0$ is the expected log expenditure when $x_{i, income} = x_{i, rural} = 0$. 

- This intercept $\beta_0$ represents the mean log expenditure for an urban CU with a log income of 0.

- The slope $\beta_1$ can be interpreted as the change in the expected log expenditure when the predictor log income of record $i$ increases by one unit, while $x_2$ stays unchanged. 

- The coefficient $\beta_2$ is the change in the expected log expenditure of a rural CU comparing to an urban CU, when the two CUs have the same log income.
