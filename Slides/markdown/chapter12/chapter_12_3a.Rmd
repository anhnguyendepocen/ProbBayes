## Example: U.S. women labor participation

- The University of Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is the longest running longitudinal household survey in the world. 

- Information on these individuals includes data covering employment, income, wealth, expenditures, health, marriage, childbearing, and child development.

- The PSID 1976 survey provides helpful self-reporting data sources for studies of married women's labor supply. A sample includes information on family income exclusive of wife's income (in \$1000) and the wife's labor participation (yes or no). 

## The PSID Sample

This PSID sample contains 753 observations and two variables. Table provides the description of each variable in the PSID sample. 


 Variable           | Description                                         |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| LaborParticipation | Binary; the labor participation status of the wife: |
|                    | 1 = yes, 0 = no                                     |
| FamilyIncome       | Continuous; the family income exclusive of wifeâ€™s   |
|                    | income, in $1000, 1975 U.S. dollars                 |


## A Prediction Problem

- Suppose one is interested in predicting a wife's labor participation status from the family income exclusive of her income. 

- The response variable (labor participation) is not continuous, but binary -- either the wife is working or she is not. 

- One is  interested in estimating the probability of a labor participation (yes) as a function of the predictor variable, family income exclusive of her income. 

- Requires a new model that can express the probability of a yes as a function of the predictor variable. 

## Graph of the Data

- Figure displays a scatterplot of the family income against the labor participation status.

- We see that roughly half of the wives are working and it is difficult to see if the family income is predictive of the participation status.

## Regression Modeling

- In Chapter 11, when one  had a continuous-valued response variable and a single continuous predictor, the mean response $\mu_i$ was be expressed as a linear function:
$$
\mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i.
$$

- Moreover we assumed the response $Y_i$ is Normally distributed with mean $\mu_i$.

- However, such a Normal density setup is not sensible for a binary response $Y_i$ since the response is not continuous-valued.

## A logistic regression model

- Recall the definition of odds was introduced -- an odds is the ratio of the probability of some event will take place over the probability of the event will not take place.  

- In the PSID example, let $p_i$ be the probability of labor participation of married woman $i$, and the corresponding odds of participation is $\frac{p_i}{1 - p_i}$.  

- If one applies a logarithm transformation\index{logarithm transformation} on the odds, one obtains a  quantity, called a log odds\index{log odds} or logit\index{logit}, that is real-valued.

- One  obtains a model for a binary response by writing the logit in terms of the linear predictor.

## A logistic regression model

- The  response $Y_i$ is assumed to have a Bernoulli distribution with probability of success $p_i$.  

- The logistic regression model writes that the logit of the probability $p_i$ is a linear function of the predictor variable $x_i$:
$$
\textrm{logit}(p_i) = \textrm{log}\left(\frac{p_i}{1 - p_i}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i.
$$

## Interpreting the model


- With the logit function, the regression coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are directly related to the log odds $\textrm{log}\left(\frac{p_i}{1 - p_i}\right)$ instead of $p_i$.

- The intercept $\beta_0$ is the log odds when the predictor takes a value of 0. In the PSID example, it refers to the  log odds of labor participation of a married woman, whose family has 0 family income exclusive of her income. 

- The slope $\beta_1$ refers to the change in the log odds of labor participation of a married woman who has an additional \$1000  family income exclusive of her own income.

## Rewriting the Model

- By rearranging the logistic model,  one expresses the regression as a nonlinear equation for the probability of success $p_i$:
$$
\textrm{log}\left(\frac{p_i}{1 - p_i}\right) =  \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i \nonumber \\ 
\frac{p_i}{1 - p_i} = \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i)  \nonumber \\
p_i = \frac{\exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i)}{1 + \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i)}.
$$
-
This equation shows that the logit function guarantees that the probability $p_i$ lies in the interval [0, 1].
