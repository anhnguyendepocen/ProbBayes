## Introduction

- The Federalist Papers were a collection of articles written in the late 18th century by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay to promote the ratification of the United States Constitution.  

- Some of these papers were written by Hamilton,  other papers were written by Madison, and the true authorship of some of the remaining papers has been in doubt.  

- Mosteller and Wallace (1963) focused on the frequencies of counts of so-called filler words such as "an", "of", and "upon".

- The use of different sampling distributions\index{sampling!distribution} is described to model word counts in a group of Federalist Papers.   

## Data on word use

- Look at the occurrences of the word "can" in all of the Federalist Papers authored by Alexander Hamilton or James Madison.  

- Table shows for each paper, the total number of words, the number of occurrences of the word "can" and the rate of this word per 1000 words.


|   | Name              | Total | word | y | Rate | Authorship |
| -: | :---------------- | ----: | :--- | -: | ---: | :--------- |
| 1 | Federalist No. 1  |  1622 | can  | 3 | 1.85 | Hamilton   |
| 2 | Federalist No. 10 |  3008 | can  | 4 | 1.33 | Madison    |
| 3 | Federalist No. 11 |  2511 | can  | 5 | 1.99 | Hamilton   |
| 4 | Federalist No. 12 |  2171 | can  | 2 | 0.92 | Hamilton   |
| 5 | Federalist No. 13 |   970 | can  | 4 | 4.12 | Hamilton   |
| 6 | Federalist No. 14 |  2159 | can  | 9 | 4.17 | Madison    |

## Graph

- Figure displays parallel jittered dotplots of the rates of "can" for the Madison and Hamilton papers.  

- Note the substantial variability in the rates across papers.

- It appears that there is slight tendency for Hamilton to use this particular word more frequently than Madison.

## Poisson density sampling

- Consider the word use of all of the Federalist Papers written by Hamilton.

- Initially assume that for the $i$-th paper the count $y_i$ of the word "can" has a Poisson density with mean $n_i \lambda /1000$ where $n_i$ is the total number of words and $\lambda$ is the true rate of the word among 1000 words. 

$$
f(Y_i = y_i \mid \lambda) = \frac{(n_i \lambda / 1000)^{y_i} \exp(-n_i \lambda / 1000)}{y_i!}.
$$

## Likelihood

- Assuming independence of word use between papers, the likelihood function is the product of Poisson densities

$$
L(\lambda) = \prod_{i = 1}^N f(y_i \mid \lambda),
$$

- Posterior\index{posterior} density of $\lambda$ is given by

$$
\pi(\lambda \mid y_1, \cdots, y_N) \propto  L(\lambda) \pi(\lambda),
$$
where $\pi()$ is the prior\index{prior} density.

## Prior

- Suppose one knows little about the true rate of "can"s

- To reflect this lack of information, one assigns $\lambda$ a Gamma density\index{Gamma!density} with parameters $\alpha = 0.001$ and $\beta = 0.001$. 

- A JAGS\index{Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS)} script below is written to specify this Bayesian model.\ 
By use of the ```run.jags()```\index{run.jags()} function, one obtains a simulated sample of 5000 draws from the posterior distribution.

```
modelString = "
model{
for (i in 1:N) {
   y[i] ~ dpois(n[i] * lambda / 1000)
}
lambda ~ dgamma(0.001, 0.001)
}
"
```

## Overdispersion?

- With count data, one general concern is **overdispersion**  

- Do the observed counts display more variability than one would anticipate with the use of this Poisson sampling model?  

- One can check for overdispersion by use of a posterior predictive\index{posterior!predictive} check.  

## Posterior predictive checking

- One simulates one replicated dataset\index{replicated dataset} from the posterior predictive distribution as follows.  

1. One simulates a value of $\lambda$ from the posterior distribution.

2. Given the simulated value $\lambda = \lambda^*$, one simulates counts $y^{R}_1, ..., y^{R}_N$ from independent Poisson distribution with means $n_1 \lambda^* / 1000, ..., n_N \lambda^* / 1000$.  

## Checking function

- Given a replicated dataset of counts \{$y^{R}_i$\}, one computes the standard deviation.  

- A standard deviation is a reasonable choice of a testing function since one is concerned about the variation\index{variation} in the data.

- R script implements simulation.

```
one_rep <- function(i){
  lambda <- post[i]
  sd(rpois(length(y), n * lambda / 1000))
}
sapply(1:5000, one_rep) -> SD
```

## Repeat

- Repeat this process 5000 times, obtaining 5000 values of the standard deviation.  

- Figure displays a histogram\index{histogram} of the standard deviations from the predictive distribution and the standard deviation of the observed counts \{$y_i$\} is displayed as a vertical line.  

```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/hamilton_pp1.png")
```

## Interpret

- The observed standard deviation is very large relative to the standard deviations of the counts from the predictive distribution. 

- We see evidence of overdispersion.

- There is more variability in the observed counts of "can"s than one would predict from the Poisson sampling model.
