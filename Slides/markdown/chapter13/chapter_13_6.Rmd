## Introduction

- The performance of a professional athlete typically begins at a small level, increases to a level where the player has peak performance, and then decreases until the player's retirement.  

- This pattern of performance over a player's career is called the __career trajectory.__  

- A general problem in sports is to predict future performance of a player  and one relevant variable in this prediction is the player's age.  

- We study career trajectories for baseball players, although the methodology will apply to athletes in other sports.

## Measuring hitting performance in baseball

- Baseball players are measured by their ability to hit, pitch, and field.

- One of the more popular measures of batting performance is the on-base percentage or OBP.  

- The OBP is defined to be the fraction of plate appearances where the batter reaches a base.  

- Chase Utley  in 2003 had 49 on-base events in 152 plate appearances and his OBP was $49 / 152 = 0.322$.

## Chase Ultley's career trajectory

- We explore career trajectories of the OBP measure of a baseball player as a function of his age.

- Figure  displays Chase Utley's OBP as a function of his age.  A quadratic smoothing curve is added.   Utley's OBP measure increases until about age 30 and then steadily decreases towards the end of his career.

## Josh Phelps' Career Trajectory

- Figure displays the career trajectory of OBP for Josh Phelps who had a relatively short baseball career.  

- Phelps does not have a clearly defined career trajectory.

## Purpose of Case Study

- The purpose of this case study is to see if one can improve the career trajectory smooth of this player by a hierarchical\index{hierarchical} Bayesian model that combines data from a number of baseball players. 

- Recall in Chapter 10, we have seen how hierarchical Bayesian models have the pooling\index{pooling} effect that could borrow information from other groups to improve the estimation of one group, especially for groups with small sample size.





## Estimating a single trajectory
\label{sec:career:single}

- Let $y_j$ denote the number of on-base events in $n_j$ plate appearances during a single hitter's $j$-th season.  

- Assume that $y_j$ has a Binomial\index{Binomial} distribution with parameters $n_j$ and probability of success $p_j$.   

- One represents the logit\index{logit} of the success probability $p_j$ as a quadratic function of the player's age $x_j$:

$$
\log \left(\frac{p_j}{1-p_j}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (x_j - 30) + \beta_2 (x_j - 30)^2
$$

## Comments

- The intercept\index{intercept parameter} $\beta_0$ is an estimate of the player's OBP performance at age 30.  

- The quadratic function reaches its largest value  at
$$
h_1(\beta) = 30 -  \frac{\beta_1}{2 \beta_2}.
$$
This is the age where the player is estimated to have his peak on-base performance during his career.

- The maximum value of the curve, on the logistic scale, is
$$
h_2(\beta) = \beta_0 - \frac{\beta_1^2}{4 \beta_2}. 
$$

## Comments (continued)

- The maximum value of the curve on the probability scale is 
$$
p_{max} = \exp(h_2(\beta)) / (1 +  \exp(h_2(\beta))).
$$
The parameter $p_{max}$ is the estimated largest OBP of the player over his career.


- The coefficient $\beta_2$, typically a negative value, tells us about the degree of curvature in the quadratic function.  

- One simple interpretation is that $\beta_2$ represents the change in OBP from his peak age to one year later.

## Fitting the Model

- Fit this Bayesian logistic model using the JAGS\index{Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS)} software.  

- Assume the regression coefficients are independent\index{independent} with each coefficient assigned a Normal prior\index{Normal!prior} with mean 0 and precision\index{precision} 0.0001.  

- The posterior\index{posterior} density of $\beta$ is given, up to an unknown proportionality constant, by
$$
\pi(\beta \mid \{y_j\}) \propto \prod_j \left( p_j ^{y_j}(1 - p_j)^{n_j - y_j} \right) \pi(\beta),
$$
where $p_j$ is defined by the logistic model and $\pi(\beta)$ is the prior density.

## R Work

The JAGS model script is shown below.  

```
modelString = "
model {
## sampling
for (j in 1:N){
   y[j] ~ dbin(p[j], n[j])
   logit(p[j]) <- beta0 + beta1 * (x[j] - 30) +
            beta2 * (x[j] - 30) * (x[j] - 30)
}
## priors
beta0 ~ dnorm(0, 0.0001)
beta1 ~ dnorm(0, 0.0001)
beta2 ~ dnorm(0, 0.0001)
}
"
```

## Simulating from Posterior

- JAGS software is used to simulate a sample from the posterior distribution of $\beta$.  

- One performs inference about the peak age function $h_1(\beta)$ by computing this function on the simulated $\beta$ draws -- the output is a posterior sample from the peak age function.   

- In a similar fashion, one  obtains a sample from the posterior of the maximum value function $p_{max}$ 

## Some Posterior Distributions

- Figure displays density estimates of the simulated values of $h_1(\beta)$ and $p_{max}$.  

- Utley's peak performance was most likely achieved at age 29

- The posterior of the peak value $p_{max}$ indicates that Utley's peak on-base probability ranged from 0.38 and 0.40.

## Estimating many trajectories by a hierarchical model

- Want to simultaneously estimate the career trajectories for a group of players.  

- Focus on the Major League players who were born in the year 1978 and had at least 1000 career at-bats.  

- Figure on next slide displays scatterplots of age and OBP with quadratic smoothing curves for the 36 players in this group.  

- Many of the curves follow a familiar concave down shape with the player achieving peak performance near an age of 30.  

- But for some players, especially for those players who played a small number of seasons, note that the trajectories have different shapes.  

## Many Career Trajectories

```

## Partially Pooling

-  May be desirable to partially pool\index{pooling!partial} the data from the 36 players using a hierarchical model to obtain improved trajectory estimates for all players.

- For the $i$-th player, one observes the on-base events \{$y_{ij}$\} which are Binomial with sample sizes $\{n_{ij}\}$ and probabilities of on-base success $\{p_{ij}\}$.  Have logistic model
$$
\log \left(\frac{p_{ij}}{1-p_{ij}}\right) = \beta_{i0} + \beta_{i1} (x_{ij} - 30) + \beta_{i2} (x_{ij} - 30)^2,
$$
where $x_{ij}$ is the age of the $i$-th player during the $j$-th season.  

- Want to estimating the regression vectors $(\beta_1, ..., \beta_N)$ for the $N$ players in the study.

## Hierarchical Prior

- Construct a two-stage prior\index{two-stage prior} on these regression vectors.  

- At Stage 1, one assumes that 
$\beta_1, ..., \beta_N$ are independent distributed from a common multivariate Normal distribution with mean vector $\mu_\beta$ and precision matrix $\tau_\beta$.  

- At Stage 2, vague prior distributions are assigned to the unknown values of $\mu_\beta$ and $\tau_\beta$.

\medskip

## R Work

- The JAGS script defining this model is a straightforward extension of the JAGS script for a logistic regression model for a single career trajectory.  

- Variables are the player ids ```player```, and the logistic parameters for the $i$th player are  ```beta0[i]```, ```beta1[i]```, and ```beta2[i]``` represent the logistic regression parameters for 

- The vector ```B[j, 1:3]``` represents a vector of parameters for one player and ```mu.beta``` and ```Tau.B``` represent respectively the second-stage prior mean vector and precision matrix values.  

- Variables ```mean```, ```prec```, ```Omega``` are specified parameters reflectin weak information about the parameters at the second stage.

## JAGS Script

```
modelString = "model {
for (i in 1:N){
   y[i] ~ dbin(p[i], n[i])
   logit(p[i]) <- beta0[player[i]] + 
                beta1[player[i]] * (x[i] - 30) +
                beta2[player[i]] * (x[i] - 30) * (x[i] - 30)
}
for (j in 1:J){
   beta0[j] <- B[j,1]
   beta1[j] <- B[j,2]
   beta2[j] <- B[j,3]
   B[j,1:3] ~ dmnorm (mu.beta[], Tau.B[,])
}
mu.beta[1:3] ~ dmnorm(mean[1:3],prec[1:3 ,1:3 ])
Tau.B[1:3 , 1:3] ~ dwish(Omega[1:3 ,1:3 ], 3)
}
"
```

## Posterior Inferences

- JAGS is used to simulate from the posterior distribution of this hierarchical model

- The player trajectories $\beta_1, ..., \beta_{36}$ are a sample from a Normal distribution with mean $\mu_\beta$.  

- Figure  on next slide displays draws of the posterior of the mean peak age $h_1(\mu_\beta)$  expressed as probabilities over a grid of age values from 23 to 37.  

- The takeaway if that a typical MLB player in this group peaks in on-base performance about age 29.5.

## Borrowing information

-  Bayesian hierarchical model is helpful in borrowing information for estimating the career trajectories of players with limited career data.

- Figure on next page shows individual and hierarchical posterior mean\index{posterior!mean} fits of the career trajectories for two players. 

- For Chase Utley, the two fits are very similar since Utley's career trajectory was well-estimated just using his data.  

- In contrast, Phelps' career trajectory is corrected to be more similar to the concave down trajectory for most players.
