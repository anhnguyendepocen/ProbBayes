## Introduction

- Suppose one collects multiple body measurements from a group of 30 students.  

- One might collect the diameter of the wrist and the diameter of the ankle.  

- If $X$ and $Y$ denote the two body measurements (measured in cm) for a student, then one might think that the density of $X$ and the density of $Y$ is each Normally distributed.  

- Moreover, the two random variables would be positively correlated; if a student has a large wrist diameter, one would predict her to also have a large forearm length.

## Bivariate Normal Density

- A convenient joint density function for two continuous measurements $X$ and $Y$is the Bivariate Normal density with density given by

$$
f(x, y) = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma_X \sigma_Y \sqrt{1 - \rho}} \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2 (1 - \rho^2)}(z_X^2 - 2 \rho z_X z_Y + z_Y^2)\right],
$$

where $z_X$ and $z_Y$ are the standardized scores

$$
z_X = \frac{x - \mu_X}{\sigma_X}, \, \, \, z_Y = \frac{y - \mu_Y}{\sigma_Y},
$$

and $\mu_X, \mu_Y$ and $\sigma_X, \sigma_Y$ are respectively the means and standard deviations of $X$ and $Y$.  

- The parameter $\rho$ is the correlation of $X$ and $Y$ and measures the association between the two variables.

```

## Explanation

- The bottom right graph corresponds to the values $\mu_X = 17, \mu_Y = 23, \sigma_X = 2, \sigma_Y = 3$ and $\rho = 0.4$ where $X$ and $Y$ represent the wrist diameter and ankle diameter measurements of the student.  

- The correlation value of $\rho = 0.4$ reflects the moderate positive correlation of the two body measurements. 

- The other three graphs use the same means and standard deviations but different values of the $\rho$ parameter.    

- We see that the Bivariate Normal distribution is able to model a variety of association structures between two continuous measurements.

## Properties

There are a number of attractive properties of the Bivariate Normal distribution.

1. **The marginal densities of $X$ and $Y$ are Normal.**  So $X$ has a Normal density  with parameters $\mu_X$ and $\sigma_X$ and likewise $Y$ is $\textrm{Norma}(\mu_Y, \sigma_Y)$.

2.  **The conditional densities will also be Normal.**  For example, if one is given that $Y = y$, then the conditional density of $X$ given $Y = y$ is Normal where

$$
E(X \mid Y = y) = \mu_X + \rho \frac{\sigma_X}{\sigma_Y}(y - \mu_Y)
$$

$$
Var(X \mid Y = y) = \sigma_X^2(1 - \rho^2).
$$

## Properties (continued)

- Similarly, if one knows that $X = x$, then the conditional density of $Y$ given $X = x$ is Normal with mean 
$$\mu_Y + \rho \frac{\sigma_Y}{\sigma_X}(x - \mu_X)$$ 
and variance 
$$\sigma_Y^2(1 - \rho^2)$$.

## Properties (continued)

3. **For a Bivariate Normal distribution, $X$ and $Y$ are independent if and only if the correlation $\rho = 0$.**  

- In contrast, as the correlation parameter $\rho$ approaches $+1$ and $-1$, then all of the probability mass will be concentrated on a line where $Y = a X + b$.

## Bivariate Normal calculations

- Recall that $X$ denotes the wrist diameter, $Y$ represents the ankle diameter and we are assuming $(X, Y)$ has a Bivariate Normal distribution with parameters $\mu_X = 17, \mu_Y = 23, \sigma_X = 2, \sigma_Y = 3$ and $\rho = 0.4$

**Find the probability a student's wrist diameter exceeds 20 cm.**

One wants the probability $P(X > 20)$.  From the facts above, the marginal density for  $X$ will be Normal with mean $\mu_X = 17$ and standard deviation $\sigma_X = 2$.  So this probability is computed using the function ```pnorm()```\index{pnorm()}:

```{r}
1 - pnorm(20, 17, 2)
```

## Bivariate Normal calculations

**Suppose one is told that the student's ankle diameter is 20 cm -- find the conditional probability $P(X > 20 \mid Y = 20)$.**

The  distribution of $X$ conditional on the value $Y = y$ is Normal with mean $\mu_X + \rho \frac{\sigma_X}{\sigma_Y}(y - \mu_Y)$ and variance  $\sigma_X^2(1 - \rho^2)$.  

$$
 E(X \mid Y = 20)  = \mu_X + \rho \frac{\sigma_X}{\sigma_Y}(y - \mu_Y)   = 16.2.
$$
 
 $$
 SD(X \mid Y = 20)  = \sqrt{\sigma_X^2(1 - \rho^2)}  
  = 1.83.
 $$

So probability is 

```{r}
1 - pnorm(20, 16.2, 1.83)
```

## Bivariate Normal calculations

**Are $X$ and $Y$ independent variables?**\index{independent}

- For a Bivariate Normal distribution, a necessary and sufficient condition for independence is that the correlation $\rho = 0$.  

- Since the correlation between the two variables is not zero, the random variables $X$ and $Y$ can not be independent.

**Find the probability a student's ankle diameter measurement is at 50 percent greater than her wrist diameter measurement, that is $P(Y > 1.5 X)$.**

- Simulation provides an attractive method of computing this probability.

## Simulating Bivariate Normal measurements

- One simulates a large number, say 1000, draws from the Bivariate Normal distribution and then finds the fraction of simulated $(x, y)$ pairs where $y > 1.5 x$. 

- Probability of interest is approximated by 0.242.
