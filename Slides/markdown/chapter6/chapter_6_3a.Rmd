## Introduction

- One can also describe probabilities when the two variables $X$ and $Y$ are continuous.  

- As a simple example, suppose that one randomly chooses two points $X$ and $Y$ on the interval (0, 2) where $X < Y$.  One defines the joint probability density function of $X$ and $Y$ to be the function
 $$
 f(x, y) =
 \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{2},  \, \, 0  < x < y <2;\\
0, \, \,{\rm elsewhere}.
\end{cases}
$$
 

## Picture

This joint pdf is viewed as a plane of constant height over the set of points $(x, y)$ where $0  < x < y <2$.  

```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200, fig.cap = "Region where the joint pdf $f(x, y)$ is positive in the choose two points example."}

## Definition of a Joint Density Function

- In the one variable situation in Chapter 5, a function $f$ is a legitimate density function or pdf if it is nonnegative over the real line and the total area under the curve is equal t to one.

- Similarly for two variables, any function $f(x, y)$ is considered a pdf if it satisfies two properties:


1. Density is nonnegative over the whole plane:

$$
f(x, y) \ge 0, \, \, {\rm for} \, {\rm all} \, \, x, y.
$$

2. The total volume under the density is equal to one:
$$
\int \int f(x, y) dx dy = 1.
$$

## Back to Example

- One can check that the pdf in our example is indeed a legitimate pdf.  

- It is pretty obvious that the density that was defined is nonnegative, but it is less clear that the integral of the density is equal to one.  

- Since the density is a plane of constant height, one computes this double integral geometrically.

- Using the familiar "one half base times height" argument, the area of the triangle in the plane is $(1/2) (2) (2) = 2$ and since the pdf has constant height of $1/2$, the volume under the surface is equal to $2 (1/2)  =1$.

## Finding Probabilities

- Probabilities about $X$ and $Y$ are found by finding volumes under the pdf surface.  

- For example, suppose one wants to find the probability $P(X + Y > 3)$.  

- The region in the $(x, y)$ plane of interest is first identified, and then one finds the volume under the joint pdf over this region.

## Region of Interest $x + y > 3$

```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Cont2_a.png")
```

- The probability $P(X + Y > 3)$ is the volume under the pdf over this shaded region.  

## Calculation of Probability

- Applying a geometric argument, one notes that the area of the shaded region is $1/4$, and so the probability of interest is $(1/4)(1/2) = 1/8$.  

- One also finds this probability by integrating the joint pdf over the region as follows:
$$
 P(X + Y < 3)  = \int_{1.5}^2 \int^y_{3-y} f(x, y) dx dy \\
  = \int_{1.5}^2 \int^y_{3-y} \frac{1}{2} dx dy 
  = \int_{1.5}^2 \frac{2 y - 3}{2}dy \\
  = \frac{y^2 - 3 y}{ 2} \Big|_{1.5}^2 
  = \frac{1}{8}.
 $$
