## Flipping a Random Coin

- Suppose one has a box of coins where the coin probabilities vary.  

- If one selects a coin from the box,  $p$, the probability the coin lands heads follows the distribution 
  $$
 g(p) =  \frac{1}{B(6, 6)} p^5 (1 - p)^5, \, \, 0 < p < 1,
 $$
where $B(6,6)$ is the Beta function.

## Graph of varying coin probabilities

This density\index{density} is plotted below.

```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200, fig.cap = "Beta(6, 6) density representing the distribution of probabilities of heads for a large collection of random coins."}

```

## Density of coin probabilities

- A couple of things to notice about this density.  
- First, the density has a significant height over much of the plausible values of the probability -- this reflects the idea that one are really unsure about the chance of observing a heads when flipped.  
- Second, the density is symmetric about $p = 0.5$, which means that the coin is equally likely to be biased towards heads or biased towards tails.
 
## Flipping the random coin

- One next flips this ``random" coin 20 times.  
 
 
- Denote the outcome of this experiment by the random variable $Y$ which is equal to the count of heads.  

- If we are given a value of the probability $p$, then $Y$ has a Binomial distribution with $n = 20$ trials\index{trial} and success probability $p$.

- This probability function is actually the conditional probability of observing $y$ heads given a value of the probability $p$:
 $$
 f(y \mid p) = {20 \choose y} p ^ y (1 - p) ^ {20 - y}, \, \, y = 0, 1, ..., 20.
 $$
 
## The Beta-Binomial density

- Given the density of $p$ and the conditional density of $Y$ conditional on $p$, one computes the joint density by the product

$$
 f(y, p) =   \, g(p) f(y \mid p) = \left[ \frac{1}{B(6, 6)} p^5 (1 - p)^5\right] \left[{20 \choose y} p ^ y (1 - p) ^ {20 - y}\right] \\
 =  \frac{1}{B(6, 6)} {20 \choose y} p^{y + 5} (1 - p)^{25 - y}, \, \, 0 < p < 1, y = 0, 1, ..., 20. \\
$$
 
- This is a mixed density in the sense that one variable ($p$) is continuous and one ($Y$) is discrete. 

- This density will be seen to be very important in our study of inference about a binomial proportion $p$ in Chapter 7.
