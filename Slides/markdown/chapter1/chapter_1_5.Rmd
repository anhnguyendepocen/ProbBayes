## The Sample Space

- A sample space lists all possible outcomes of a random experiment. 

- There are different ways to write down the sample space, depending on how one thinks about outcomes.   

- Let's illustrate the variety of sample spaces by the simple experiment "roll two fair dice."

## Rolling Two Dice

- Each die is the usual six-sided object that we are familiar with, with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 on each side.  

- One is imagining that each die is constructed such that the six possible numbers are equally likely to come up when rolled.

- What can happen when you roll two dice?  The collection of all outcomes that are possible is the sample space.  

## Sum of the Rolls

- Suppose one is interested in the sum of the numbers on the two dice. What are the possible sums?  

- So the sample space, denoted by $S$, would be

$S$ = \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\}.


## Record Roll on Each Die

- Suppose instead that one wishes to record the rolls on each of the two dice.  One possible outcome would be 

(4 on one die, 3 on the other die) or (4, 3).  

- There are twenty-one possibilities:

| |  | 
----|----|----|----
(1, 1) | (1, 2) | (1, 3) | (1, 4)
(1, 5) | (1, 6) | (2, 2) | (2, 3)
(2, 4) | (2, 5) | (2, 6) | (3, 3)
(3, 4) | (3, 5) | (3, 6) | (4, 4)
(4, 5) | (4, 6) | (5, 5) | (5, 6)
(6, 6) | | |


## Distinguish the Dice

- What if we distinguished the two dice -- perhaps one die is red and one die is white.

- One are considering all of the possible rolls of both dice.  

- One way of representing possible rolls of two distinct dice is by a tree diagram shown in the Figure on the next slide.  

## Tree Diagram

```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 130}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/twodice.png")
```

## Other Ways of Showing Sample Space

- Write down an outcome by the ordered pair

(roll on white die, roll on red die).

Then table shows the possible outcomes.

  |  |   |  |  |
----|----|----|----|----|----
(1, 1) | (1, 2) | (1, 3) | (1, 4) | (1, 5) | (1, 6)
(2, 1) | (2, 2) | (2, 3) | (2, 4) | (2, 5) | (2, 6) 
(3, 1) | (3, 2) | (3, 3) | (3, 4) | (3, 5) | (3, 6)
(4, 1) | (4, 2) | (4, 3) | (4, 4) | (4, 5) | (4, 6) 
(5, 1) | (5, 2) | (5, 3) | (5, 4) | (5, 5) | (5, 6)
(6, 1) | (6, 2) | (6, 3) | (6, 4) | (6, 5) | (6, 6)

## Three ways of representing the sample space

- These representations differ by how one records the outcome of rolling two dice.  

- One either (1) records the sum of the two dice, (2) records the individual rolls, not distinguishing the two dice, or (3) records the individual rolls, distinguishing the two dice.

## Which sample space is best?

- All of the sample spaces shown above are correct.  Each sample space represents all possible outcomes of the experiment of rolling two dice.

- But some sample spaces are more convenient than other sample spaces when one wishes to assign probabilities.

- For rolling two fair dice, the sample space with distinguishable dice is desirable from the viewpoint of computing probabilities since the outcomes are equally likely.

- In writing down a sample space, one uses whatever method one likes.  The important thing is that one has displayed all of the possible outcomes in $S$.
