## Introduction

- The classical view of probability is helpful  when we can construct a list of outcomes of the experiment in such a way where the outcomes are equally likely.

- The frequency interpretation of probability can be used in cases where outcomes are equally likely or not equally likely.

- This view of probability is appropriate when one is able to repeat the random experiment many times under the same conditions.

## Getting out of jail in Monopoly

- Suppose someone is playing the popular game Monopoly and she lands in jail.  

- To get out of jail on the next turn, she either pays $50 or roll "doubles" when she rolls two fair dice.  

- What is the probability of rolling doubles when she rolls two dice?

## Applying the frequency viewpoint

- The frequency notion can be applied to approximate the probability of rolling doubles.  

- Imagine rolling two dice many times under similar conditions.  

- Each time two dice are rolled, one observes if she get doubles or not.  

- The probability of doubles is approximated by the relative frequency\index{relative frequency}

$$
Prob({\rm doubles}) \approx \frac{{\rm Number} \, {\rm of} \, {\rm doubles}}{{\rm Number} \, {\rm of} \, {\rm experiments}}.
$$

## Rolling two dice using R

- The ```two_rolls()```\index{two_rolls()} function simulates rolls of a pair of dice and the ```replicate()```\index{replicate()} function repeats this process 1000 times and stores the outcomes in the variable ```many_rolls```.

```{r}
two_rolls <- function(){
  sample(1:6, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
}
many_rolls <- replicate(1000, two_rolls())
```

## Results of 10 experiments

- The results of the first 10 experiments are shown below.  For each experiment, one records if there is a match (YES) or no match (NO) in the two numbers that are rolled. 

```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/10_2dicerolls.png")
```
 
## After 50 rolls ..

- In the first 50 rolls we observed a match 7 times, so 

- $Prob(match) \approx$ 7/50 = 0.14.


## After 10,000 rolls ...

- Let's now roll the two dice 10,000 times with R -- this time, 1662 matches are observed, so 

$$Prob(match) \approx 1662/10000 = 0.1662.$$

- Is 0.1662 the actual probability of getting doubles?  

- No, it is still only an approximation to the actual probability. However, as one continues to roll dice, the relative frequency will approach the actual probability of 1/6.

## Obtaining the exact probability

- In this example, one can show that are $6 \times 6 = 36$ equally likely ways of rolling two distinguishable dice 

- There are exactly six ways of rolling doubles. 

- So using the classical viewpoint, the probability of doubles is $6/36 =1/6$.
