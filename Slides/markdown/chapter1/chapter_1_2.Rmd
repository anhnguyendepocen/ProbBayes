## Introduction

- Observe some phenomena (say, the rolls of two dice) where the outcome is random. 

- Write down the list of all possible outcomes, and believe that each outcome in the list has the same probability.  

- Then the probability of each outcome will be

\begin{equation}
Prob({\rm Outcome}) = \frac{1}{{\rm Number of outcomes}}.
\end{equation}
 
## Balls in Bowl Example

- Suppose one has a bowl with 4 white and 2 brown balls  and two balls from the bowl are drawn at random.

```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ballsinbowl1.png")
```

- Assume that the balls are drawn without replacement

- What are possible outcomes? 


## One Way to Think About Outcomes

- Suppose you don't distinguish between balls of the same color

- Then there are three possible outcomes  --  one chooses 0 brown, 1 brown, or 2 brown balls.

```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ballsinbowl2.png")
```
 
## Another Way to Think About Outcomes

- Supose one does distinguish between the balls of the same color.

- Label the balls in the bowl and then write down 15 distinct outcomes.

```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ballsinbowl3.png")
```


```{r,  echo = FALSE, out.width = 200}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ballsinbowl4.png")
```


## Which is the more appropriate way of listing outcomes?

- To apply the classical view of probability, one has to assume that the outcomes are all equally likely. 

- In the first list of three outcomes, one can't assume that they are equally likely.  It is more likely to choose two white balls than to choose two brown balls.  

- On the other hand, since one are choosing two balls at random from the basket, it makes sense that the 15 outcomes in the second listing are equally likely.  

- So one applies the classical notion and assign a probability of 1/15 to each of the possible outcomes.
