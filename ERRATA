THE ERRATA LIST - 1/19/20

1.  Page 19, line 17.  Should be

P(F union L) = P(F) + P(L) - P(F intersect L)

2.  Page 124, Table 4.13.  The last two values in the third column should be 22 and 24 (instead of 12 and 14).

3.  Page 124, Exercise 8.  First line is missing.  It should read:  "Box 1 contains four slips numbered 1 through 4 and Box 2 contains five slips numbered 2 through 6.

4.  Page 229, line 7.  Should be "is tedious, however practice with the"

5.  Page 212, Exercise 13 (b).  The integral identity should be

integral_0^infty exp(-a lambda) lambda^b dlambda = b! / a ^{b+1}

6.  Page 214, Exercise 20, part (a), line 1.  Should be:  Write an R function to simulate 10 balls drawn with replacement of the special weighted box.

7.  Page 354, Exercise 2.  The third row of the transition matrix P should be [0 .2, .6, .2 0]

8.  Page 448.  The prior standard deviations of beta0 and beta1 are 20 and 15 and so the corresponding precisions are 1 / 20 ^ 2 and 1 / 15 ^ 2.  These precision values (not the standard deviations) should be used in the JAGS script.  Figure 11.13 should be redrawn using the correct precision values.

9.  Page 522.  In the R code, the variables m and n should be switched.  Here is the correct R script.

set.seed(123)p0 <- 0.40; p1 <- 0.70m <- 20; n <- 50; p <- 0.2z <- sample(0:1, size = m, prob = c(p, 1-p),replace = TRUE)prob <- (z == 0) * p0 + (z == 1) * p1y <- rbinom(m, size = n, prob)
